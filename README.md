## About The Project

The traditional vaccination process often suffers from long queues, mismanagement of vaccine stock, and unreliable paper-based records. This project aims to solve these issues by providing a centralized digital platform.

Our system bridges the gap between vaccine supply and demand by digitizing appointment scheduling, application reviews, and record-keeping, making the entire process faster, more transparent, and easier to manage on a mobile device.

## Key Features

* **Online Registration:** Submit personal details securely to the Cloud Firestore database.
* **Center Selection:** Choose a preferred vaccination center from a list of available options.
* **Easy Application:** Submit a vaccination application directly from the app.
* **Real-time Status Tracking:** Check the status of an application (Pending, Approved, Rejected) in real-time.

### For Administrators:
* **Admin Dashboard:** View and manage all incoming vaccination applications from a dedicated interface.
* **Application Review:** Approve or reject applications based on eligibility and vaccine availability.
